# Lost-In-Space Game

This game was created by me for a University Project under the supervision of Professor Glory Lee Deakin University. A map is created to make it easier for players to locate the power ups. The power ups are designed to randomly appear at random coordinates. It is designed such that when the player collides with a power up their score automatically increases and the game is over when the player(rocket) runs out of fuel. A link is attached below for visual explanation.
